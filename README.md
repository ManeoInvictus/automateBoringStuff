# automateBoringStuff
A repository of the exercises from the course 'Automate the Boring Stuff', broken down into their respective sections.
The course was done to get a formal introduction to `python` programming language and also learn things like file handling, web scrapping and some GUI automation.
I highly recommend doing this course, or atleast go through the book (which one could read for free from https://automatetheboringstuff.com/). You never know what part of your life could be automated!
